## Imagining the Future: Science Fiction Films Through Time

### Presentation: [Click Here][1]

Science fiction films both represent what we aspire to be and do, while also reflect our current fears and concerns. In this project I scraped every science fiction film since 1920 with a Wikipedia entry. I used Natural Language Processing to examine word use over time. I also built a companion app that plots word usage over time, similar in spirit to the Google NGram project. I also tried using both static and dynamic topic modeling, but the findings were not particularly enlightening. However the code is included for those interested in using the method for other projects.

There is a scraping notebook that goes through how to scrape wikipedia, as well as an analysis notebook. Enjoy!
